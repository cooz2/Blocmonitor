 Interactive clipboard with web3.js, truffle webpack and solidity
 
 Hello ! First commit on Github, such a pleasure to present you 'Bloctoad explorer'
 
  I firstly thought about a p2p chat system in first place, but i realized that we can simply use
 the memory pilestack from EVM.
 
 I'd like to credit https://github.com/devbootstrap for the tutorial on 'How to monitoring blockchains transactions'. Helped me a lot. 
 
 You'd first need an eth socket to get a connection, 
 please process by reviewing code first, so debug would be great !
